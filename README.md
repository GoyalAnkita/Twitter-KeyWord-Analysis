# Twitter-KeyWord-Analysis

•	Implemented Zipf’s law using R studio to visualize the frequency and distribution of the top 20% words by reviewing one million Elon Musks’s tweets from 2010-2021

The R-code has various steps:

1. Computed word frequencies for each year. Excluded the stop words
2. Show top 10 words (for each year) by the highest value of word frequency
3. Plot histogram of word frequencies for each year
4. Use Zipf’s law and plot log-log plots of word frequencies and rank for each year
5. Created bigram network graphs for each year
